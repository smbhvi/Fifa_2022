# Fifa_2022
Project Overview:
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a football dataset containing match-level statistics (64 matches √ó 88 features).
The goal is to extract key insights into match outcomes, offensive and defensive performance, passing build-up play, and possession strategies.
To make the analysis more interactive and business-friendly, I also built a Power BI Dashboard showcasing team performance, match trends, and winning factors.

Columns: 88 (team performance metrics)
Features Include:
Goals scored & conceded
